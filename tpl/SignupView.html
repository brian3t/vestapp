            which is knowingly false and/or defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene,
            profane, sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person’s privacy, or otherwise violating any law,
            including, but not limited to, any material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal
            offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or
            international law. User agrees not to post any copyrighted material unless the copyright is owned by User or
            by the mobile app. Although Commuter Connections and MWCOG do not and cannot review the electronic
            communications posted and are not responsible for the content of any of these messages, Commuter Connections
            reserves the right to delete any electronic communication for any or no reason whatsoever. User remains
            solely responsible for the content of the electronic communication, and User agrees to indemnify and hold
            harmless MWCOG and Commuter Connections, and their agents with respect to any claim, including attorney’s
            fees incurred responding to such claim, based upon transmission of User’s message(s), to the full extent
            permitted by applicable law.
            <br><br>
            Commuter Connections may disclose any Content or electronic communication of any kind (i) to satisfy any
            law, regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate

            Providers, and MWCOG. Commuter Connections reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communication, or Content
            that it deems in its sole discretion to be harmful to individual Users, Commuter Connections, MWCOG, the
            communities that Commuter Connections serves, or any rights of Commuter Connections or any third party, or
            to violate any applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Commuter Connections nor its Providers
            can ensure prompt removal of questionable Content after online posting. Accordingly, neither Commuter
            Connections nor MWCOG, nor their affiliates, nor any of their officers, directors, employees, or agents, nor
            Providers shall assume liability for any action or inaction with respect to conduct, communication, or

            <br><br>
            <b>V. PRIVACY POLICY</b>
            <br><br>
            In accordance with the terms of Commuter Connections’ Privacy Policy, Commuter Connections respects the
            privacy of its Users. Commuter Connections collects information about Users when they use its mobile
            applications, websites, and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) and through
            other interactions and communications via email or through the Commuter Connections call center.
            <br><br>

            program request purposes only. All personal information will remain confidential. Commuter Connections will
            not share or sell User information to outside organizations or companies.
            <br><br>
            Commuter Connections collects information Users provide directly, such as when User creates or modifies
            User’s account, requests on-demand carpool services, contacts the Commuter Connections call center via email
            or by telephone, or directly communicates with Commuter Connections in any way. This information may
            include: name, email, phone number(s), postal address, profile picture, and other information User chooses
            to provide. Commuter Connections does not provide transportation services and is not a transportation
            carrier. It is up to User’s sole discretion to decide whether or not to offer or accept a ride through the
            CarpoolNow mobile app.
            <br><br>

            Commuters determine what contact information they share with other commuters. Your home address is not given
            to other commuters, unless the commuter elects to share it with other commuters through their commuter
            profile.<br><br>

                <li><b>Log Information:</b>
                    When you interact with the CarpoolNow mobile app, we collect server logs, which may include
                    information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app
                    crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were
                    using before interacting with our Services.

            Most mobile platforms have defined certain types of device data that mobile apps cannot access without
            User’s consent. These platforms may have different permission systems for obtaining User’s consent. For more
            information on platform level permissions that the mobile app may seek, User should visit your smart phone
            applications permissions web site page.
            <br><br>
            We request permission for the CarpoolNow mobile app collection of precise location from your device per the
            permission system used by your mobile phone’s operating system. If you initially permit the collection of
            this information, you can later disable it by changing the location settings on your mobile device. However,
            this will limit your ability to use certain the CarpoolNow mobile app features. Additionally, disabling the
            mobile app’s collection of precise location from your device will not limit our ability to collect your trip
            location information from a rider’s or driver's device nor our ability to derive approximate location from
            your IP address.
            <br><br>

            We may seek permission for Commuter Connections’ app’s collection and syncing of contact information from
            your device per the permission system used by your mobile operating system.
            <br><br>
            Commuter Connections may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we
            collect through the CarpoolNow mobile app. For example:
            <br><br>

            • If you choose to link, create, or log in to your Commuter Connections account with a social media service,
            or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our Application Programming Interface (“API”) (or
            whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.
            <br><br>
            • If you also interact with our programs in another capacity, for instance as a user of other mobile apps or
            web sites we provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected from
            you in your capacity as a CarpoolNow mobile app User. We may use the information we collect about you to:

            <b>X. SEVERABILITY</b>
            <br><br>
            The provisions of these Terms of Use are intended to be severable. If for any reason any provision of these
            Terms of Use shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision
            shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without

            provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.
            <br><br>
            <b>XI. MODIFICATION</b>
